    "we'll start with common preprocessing step of tokenizing the data.  This converts the string text into an array of numbers that can be used during the training loop.  I've built a very subtle byte-pair encdoing that has each unique character that appears and the top 5 merges. This keeps our vocab size small and managable for this example. Typically the vocab size is in the 100K+ range. A great library for this is `tiktoken`. Tokenization simply finds the longest pattern of characters that's in common with what was trained and replaces it with an integer that represents it.  This way we turn the text into a numeric array to simplify computing. import torch\n",

We'll show 3 steps that are focused on training:\n",
    "1. **Data Loading** `x, y = train_loader.next_batch()` - this step pulls from the raw data enough tokens to complete a forward and backward pass.  If the model is inference only, this step is replaced with taking in the inference input and preparing it similarly as the forward pass.\n",
    "2. **Forward Pass** `logits, loss = model(x, y)` - using the data and the model architecture to predict the next token. When training we also compare against the expected to get loss, but in infrerence, we use the logits to complete the inference task.\n",
    "3. **Backward Pass & Training** `loss.backward(); optimizer.step()` - using differentials to understand what parameters most impact the forward pass' impact on its prediction, comparing that against what is actually right based on the data loading step, and then making very minor adjustments to the impactful parameters with the hope it improves future predictions.\n",

    "The we'll show a final **Forward Pass** with the updated weights we did in #3. "
