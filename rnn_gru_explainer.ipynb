    "# RNN GRU Explainer\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to walk through RNNs (recurrent neural networks), there are 2 flavors: GRUs and LSTMs. We'll focus on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRUs). RNN's have a unique structure where they process data sequentially which enables them to take in both the current and a prior state, making them great for sequential data like time series or streamed data.  The core unit of the RNN takes in both the data you want to use to make an inference along with any previous context. While this is great there are a few dangers of the RNN: primarily that improper setup and training can lead to vanishing/exploding gradients and their sequential nature can consume a lot of resources. As you go through this notebook you can hopefully see why this would be the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help display how the RNN works, we'll use the first sentence from the [linear algebra wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) and [lu decomposition wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition) as the topic is fitting and it shows us some non-standard patterns.  We'll take on a more simple task to many other notebooks in this repository where we have a few sentences of text and want to predict some other text, in this case the next token. "

    "We'll start with a common preprocessing step of tokenizing the data.  This converts the string text into an array of numbers that can be used during the training loop.  I've built a very subtle byte-pair encoding that has each unique character that appears and the top 5 merges. This keeps our vocab size small and manageable for this example. Typically the vocab size is in the 100K+ range. A great library for this is `tiktoken`. Tokenization simply finds the longest pattern of characters that's in common with what was trained and replaces it with an integer that represents it.  This way we turn the text into a numeric array to simplify computing. import torch\n",

The embedding weights are `vocab_size X n_embd` and simply store weights that correspond with each token.  The more embedding layers added the more complex data the model can learn. After the embedding layer we'll then perform dropout. The **dropout layer** simply applies 0's  randomly up to the defined level percentage and normalizes the remaining probabilities in the row. Since RNNs recycle the same parameters across timesteps, features can co-adapt and overfit quickly. Variational dropout breaks these temporal co-adaptations and adds needed noise where there’s little implicit regularization.

    "At a high level, you'll see that our GRU acts as our recurrent unit.  This unit does not take in the whole context `X` but rather iteratively takes in a specific time point $X_t$, calculates its weights $H_t$. If there are more time points, for us meaning more tokens in the string, the unit then takes in that weight, represented as $H_{prev}$, and the next time point, represented again as $X_t$ and reruns the unit, until all time points are exhausted. \n",
    "\n",
    "To manage the impact of the incoming state and the long term memory, GRUs use two gates: the reset gate and the update gate. Both of these gates push their values to lie between $[0,1]$ through the use of a sigmoid activation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mentally the **Update Gate**  $Z$ controls how much of the new state is a copy of the old vs being new. We achieve this by applying the linearization $AX+WH+b$ to both the previous weights $H_{prev}$ and the incoming weights $X_t$. This results in a gate that acts as a learnable proportion that controls what proportion of the previous chain is through $Z \\odot H_{prev}$ and the remaining proportion is applied to the candidate hidden state $(1 - Z) \\odot \\tilde{H}_t$ as calculated through the *Reset Gate*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Reset Gate** $R$ is our control on how much of the previous state to remember in the candidate hidden state.  We similarly calculate this by applying the linearization $AX+WH+b$ to both the previous weights $H_{prev}$ and the incoming weights $X_t$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Candidate Hidden State** $\\tilde{H}_t$ is our representation of the impact of the timepoint's specific context $X_t$  given the previous context $H_{prev}$.  The amount of previous context is decided by the *reset gate* $R$ that's learned. We again use linearization to these two inputs $AX+WR\\odot H+b$ and then wrap it in a $tanh$ to pull the values to $[-1,1]$ to limit the candidate hidden state’s magnitude and keeps activations zero-centered, improving stability and optimization while the gates handle long-range impact assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that we use the $\\odot$ representing the Hadamard product, or the element wise multiple, instead of the dot product.  In RNNs we use this because the gates are meant to be per-feature “valves.” The update uses elementwise products to preserve the shape and provide an element wise identity path for gradients. A dot product would either collapse to a scalar (vector·vector) or mix features via a full matrix multiply, which changes the operation from gating to another affine transform, adds parameters, couples coordinates, and weakens the stable skip-like behavior that helps GRUs retain memory and avoid vanishing gradients.\n",

This will help us understand what is happening inside a pass and then how the impact of the weights adds up over the context length. To keep things simple we'll set the `hidden_size` to 4. Let's start by initiating our weights.  To visualize the impact of each set of weights, I'll initialize the current context and the previous context weights to two different values."

Once those layers are complete and we've done dropout normalization, during the forward pass we then start the output process that results in `logits` which is a representation of the probability of each token being the next token given the input.  \n",

    "This layer is also known as the model **head**. This layer is called this because it is a small, task-specific module attached to a model’s shared backbone that maps hidden features to the final outputs.  In our example case, this is a linear layer mapping the backbone to vocab logits. The benefit of this structure is that you can use the shared hidden features and train different heads for different tasks without starting from scratch.

    "The process of learning now requires us to update our weights based on this gradient. To really feel the \"back propagation\" we'll start with the last layer and work backwards, though, since we have all of the gradients calculated already, the order does not matter. Recall that our loss function is the negative log likelihood ratio so our gradient signs are flipped.  If a parameter is important, the gradient will be more negative, and vice versa. The gradients are a ratio of importance of each parameter and we need to know how much of that gradient to apply to our weights. This \"how much\" is referred to as the *learning rate*. In modern training learning rate schedulers and optimizers are used to vary the rate and application by layer and by training round with learning rates that are small (e.g. 1e-3) and decaying. \n",
    "\n",
    "We however are trying to learn and if you look at the gradient above in most layers it's tiny (~1e-10).  If we used a typical learning rate scheduler, with our context, batch size, and just 1 pass, the second pass would just have the same values and we wouldn't learn anything new.  Because of this we'll do something super unorthodox.  Our LM_head will use a learning rate of `5.000` but for the rest of the layers we'll use a learning rate of `1e6`. This INSANE learning rate would absolutely be too noisy for real training as taking that \"large\" of steps would mean the model could never find a good fit.  But since we're doing 1 step we don't care. Also, we're rerunning on the same example we used in the first loop so even less of a care. But as a warning, DO NOT DO THIS IN REAL TRAINING. If you did your model would most likely not converge. "

    "Next we'll update our two linear layers inside of the GRU.  Recall that we initiated h2g to weights `0.2500`, x2g weights to `0.5000` and the biases to.  Our gradients on this layer are extremely small (~1e-9). We can see that the gradients are both positive and negative suggesting the model is starting to learn patterns in the position of text that impact the next token prediction.  Also we can see that `x2g` has consistent gradients across all embedding positions, but `h2g` does not, showing that `x2g` is starting to learn more complex embedding relationships. Together, this is starting to show how the different embedding layers can impact the recursion. \n",

    "With these layers you can see the beauty of our insanely high learning rate.  Even though our gradient impact was tiny, we can see the weight shift away from the initialization suggesting some level of adaptation. "

    "Now we do our final projection against the LM head. We have seen our Y and, if we select some examples, we can see that the logit for the  examples are upweighted (e.g. position 15 on example 1, position 32 on example 2). We can also see that this training is not perfect since, if we look at those positions in other examples (e.g. position 32 in example 1) it's also upweighted.  This shows that while our model is learning, it still has a long way to go before being trained. "
