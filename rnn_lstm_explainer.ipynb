    "# RNN LSTM Explainer\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to walk through RNNs (recurrent neural networks), there are 2 flavors: GRUs and LSTMs. We'll focus on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). LSTM's have a unique structure where they process data sequentially which enables them to take in both the current and a prior state, making them great for sequential data like time series or streamed data.  The core unit of the LSTM takes in both the data you want to use to make an inference along with any previous context. LSTMs' memory cell uses three “gates”: an input gate, a forget gate, and an output gate. These gates allow the model to decide which information to keep, which to forget, and when to use it. GRU's only have the 2 gates for input and forget. While this is great there are a few dangers of RNNs: primarily that improper setup and training can lead to vanishing/exploding gradients and their sequential nature can consume a lot of resources.  The LSTM structure was built to fight the vanishing gradient problem. When coupled with grdient clipping it can help fight the vanishing/exploding gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help display how the LSTMs works, we'll use the first sentence from the [linear algebra wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) and [lu decomposition wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition) as the topic is fitting and it shows us some non-standard patterns.  We'll take on a more simple task to many other notebooks in this repository where we have a few sentences of text and want to predict some other text, in this case the next token. "

    "We'll start with a common preprocessing step of tokenizing the data.  This converts the string text into an array of numbers that can be used during the training loop.  I've built a very subtle byte-pair encoding that has each unique character that appears and the top 5 merges. This keeps our vocab size small and manageable for this example. Typically the vocab size is in the 100K+ range. A great library for this is `tiktoken`. Tokenization simply finds the longest pattern of characters that's in common with what was trained and replaces it with an integer that represents it.  This way we turn the text into a numeric array to simplify computing. import torch\n",

The embedding weights are `vocab_size X n_embd` and simply store weights that correspond with each token.  The more embedding layers added the more complex data the model can learn. After the embedding layer we'll then perform dropout. The **dropout layer** simply applies 0's  randomly up to the defined level percentage and normalizes the remaining probabilities in the row. Since RNNs recycle the same parameters across timesteps, features can co-adapt and overfit quickly. Variational dropout breaks these temporal co-adaptations and adds needed noise where there’s little implicit regularization.

    "The recurrent unit we'll explore in this notebook is the Long-term Short-term memory unit, or LSTM.  Like other recurrent units, this acts iteratively on specific time points of X labeled $X_t$.  If there are more time points, for us meaning more tokens in the string, the unit then takes in that weight, represented as $H_{prev}$, and the next time point, represented again as $X_t$ and reruns the unit, until all time points are exhausted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our recurrent unit in this case creates 2 outputs: the *memory cell* $C_t$ and the *hidden state* $H_t$.  During recursion, both are input in parallel with our input context $X_t$ and maintained with the memory cell acting as our long term memory but once recursion is complete only the hidden state moves forward.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To manage the impact of the input context $X_t$, memory cell $C_t$ and hidden state $H_t$, LSTMs use 3 gates: input gate $I_t$, forget gate $F_t$, and output gate $O_t$. These gates created by simply applying a linearization and summation to the input context and incoming hidden state,  are wrapped in sigmoid function pushing their values to between $\\left(0,1\\right)$ act as learnable proportions that control how much of each of the input, memory, and hidden state are maintained in a recursion.  By having these 3 gates combined with the use of the Hadamard product to force gradients down to an element-wise level, during training RNNs can learn the impacts of a token and pattern whether its in the context window or if it's been previously seen. You can think of the gates as being a learnable Switch that says \"when making a prediction of Y, how much of X should I use and how much of the history should I use\".  With LSTMs, as the name implies, we have 2 types of history, the long term \n",

The input state for us will be a combination of the input context $X_t$ and incoming hidden state $H_t$  as the point of RNNs is to use both the incoming context and the longer term context to make a prediction for the output.  We do this by doing a linearization and summation to the input context and incoming hidden state and then normalizing using $tanh$ to squeeze the values to $\\left(-1,1\\right)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining part of the memory cell  uses the **Forget Gate** $F_t$.  The forget gate controls how much of the current longer term memory is retained or forgotten during the memory cell update.  The forget gate is multiplied, using the Hadamard product, by the incoming memory cell $C_t$. This product is then summed with the Hadamard product of the input gate and input state to result in our updated memory cell $C_{t+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Output Gate** $O_t$ then determines how much of the memory cell to use to  influence the current time steps updated hidden step $H_{t+1}$.

Luckily our examples are incremental (example 1 is token 1, example 2 is tokens 1 and 2) so we can iteratively calculate our LSTM weights per example and use that collectively as the weight for each example.  But to start we'll need to extract just the example for the first time  period `t=0` into `x_t` for each batch and calculate our weights.

Often this step has “locked” dropout, meaning a single mask broadcast across time, which gives the same effect as per-step dropout with a fixed mask but avoids i.i.d. noise at every timestep.  We, however, will be doing default dropout that is not locked to simplify our code. \n",

    "The LSTM unit is our recurrent unit for this example. In practice, this unit can be scaled by increasing the hidden_size dimension or increasing the complexity and flavors of the recurring unit. Once those layers are complete and we've done dropout normalization, during the forward pass we then start the output process that results in `logits` which is a representation of the probability of each token being the next token given the input.  \n",

    "This layer is also known as the model **head**. This layer is called this because it is a small, task-specific module attached to a model’s shared backbone that maps hidden features to the final outputs.  In our example case, this is a linear layer mapping the backbone to vocab logits. The benefit of this structure is that you can use the shared hidden features and train different heads for different tasks without starting from scratch. An example would be a classifier head, or policy head in RL.\n",

    "The process of learning now requires us to update our weights based on this gradient. To really feel the \"back propagation\" we'll start with the last layer and work backwards, though, since we have all of the gradients calculated already, the order does not matter. Recall that our loss function is the negative log likelihood ratio so our gradient signs are flipped.  If a parameter is important, the gradient will be more negative, and vice versa. The gradients are a ratio of importance of each parameter and we need to know how much of that gradient to apply to our weights. This \"how much\" is referred to as the *learning rate*. In modern training learning rate schedulers and optimizers are used to vary the rate and application by layer and by training round with learning rates that are small (e.g. 1e-3) and decaying. \n",
    "\n",
    "We however are trying to learn and if you look at the gradient above in most layers it's tiny (~1e-10).  If we used a typical learning rate scheduler, with our context, batch size, and just 1 pass, the second pass would just have the same values and we wouldn't learn anything new.  Because of this we'll do something super unorthodox.  Our LM_head will use a learning rate of `5.000` but for the rest of the layers we'll use a learning rate of `1e6`. This INSANE learning rate would absolutely be too noisy for real training as taking that \"large\" of steps would mean the model could never find a good fit.  But since we're doing 1 step we don't care. Also, we're rerunning on the same example we used in the first loop so even less of a care. But as a warning, DO NOT DO THIS IN REAL TRAINING. If you did your model would most likely not converge. "

    "Now we do our final projection against the LM head. We have seen our Y and, if we select some examples, we can see that the logit for the  examples are upweighted (e.g. position 15 on example 1, position 32 on example 2). We can also see that this training is not perfect since, if we look at those positions in other examples (e.g. position 32 in example 1) it's also upweighted.  This shows that while our model is learning, it still has a long way to go before being trained. "

Because of this we need to convert our weight to probabilities.  The most common approach is to use Softmax, which rescales a tensor so that the elements of the n-dimensional output Tensor lie in the range `(0,1)` and sum to 1. This is done applying the following formula based on the dimension specified:\n",

    "Now that we have probabilities, we can now perform our sampling. Because next-token sampling is a categorical draw from the model’s softmax, `torch.multinomial` is the go-to choice for sampling from discrete distributions.  Multinomial takes non-negative weights (e.g., $\\mathrm{softmax}(\\ell/T)$ or $\\exp(\\ell/T))$ and returns indices without having to write complex loops. You can also tune its behavior with different temperatures and using top-k/top-p slicing. We'll keep things simple and just draw a single token. \n",

    "So you might look at this now and say \"wait, the predicted text is mostly different than our correct text, yet our loss decreased, what's going on?\".  To this I'd point to our loss function, it compares all logits, so as long as the probability for the right logit increases and the wrong logits decrease, the loss will decrease, yet, unless it's 0, it's not perfect. One other interesting thing here is that you can also see that 1 token != 1 character. In our tokenizer we use merges to represent common patterns as a single token so, when that token is predicted as next, the example gets all the characters for that merge.  "
